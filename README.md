A test project written in Java using its in-built Swing API for rendering.

My aims for this proejct:
  - Use an Object-Oriented language to develop a working game protoype
  - Understand core conepts such as Game Loops (tickRates, nanoTime etc...), Frame Buffers, Buffered Images and specialised usages of multi-threading

Targets:
  - Transition the project from using Swing to either:
    - LWJGL, LibGDX, Raylib
    - Target Date: 01/09/2025
    - Justification :
        - The Swing API isn't built for continualy rendering and re-drawing JComponents the way I am using it in the project. Continued usage of this framework will eventually lead to poor performance
        - Learning a framework such as LWJGL will expose me to more low-level forms of rendering/drawing using the GPU and standard means of developing, meaning I'll be able to dive deep into the following concepts:
